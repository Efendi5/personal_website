              I was self-employed for several years, but I have always been
              captivated by the world of programming, <br /> which eventually
              led me to attend a bootcamp. There, I learned a lot and I continue
              to expand <br /> my knowledge in this field. As a junior front-end
              developer, I possess a strong skill set in <br /> HTML, CSS,
              JavaScript, React, React Native, and TypeScript. The realm of
              programming is as vast <br /> as my hunger for knowledge in this
              domain. I take pleasure in writing clean and optimized code,{" "}
              <br /> and I am familiar with the use of cutting-edge development
              tools. Furthermore, I am <br /> a team player who enjoys
              collaborating with others because I believe that strength lies in
              unity.
