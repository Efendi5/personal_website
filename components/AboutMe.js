              I was self-employed for several years, but I have always been
              captivated by the world of programming, which eventually led me to
              attend a bootcamp. There, I learned a lot and I continue to expand
              my knowledge in this field. As a junior front-end developer, I
              possess a strong skill set in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, React
              Native, and TypeScript. The realm of programming is as vast as my
              hunger for knowledge in this domain. I take pleasure in writing
              clean and optimized code, and I am familiar with the use of
              cutting-edge development tools. Furthermore, I am a team player
              who enjoys collaborating with others because I believe that
              strength lies in unity.
